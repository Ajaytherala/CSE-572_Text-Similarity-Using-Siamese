# CSE-572_Text-Similarity-Using-Siamese
Automated answer validation systems for e-learning
platforms have always been cost-effective aid without
the requirement of manual labor. From the past few
years, significant research has been made in the
essay-based question answering domain, but in our
work we will be addressing a relatively typical and
narrower science question answering domain in the
multiple choice version of question answering. With
the progression of technology, it's apparent that deep
learning techniques have surpassed the performance
of traditional Information Retrieval methods. On a
distinct vision, we propose a dual validation
approach, employing Siamese Networks (a deep
learning neural network for text similarity) alongside
evaluations based on Large Language Models.
